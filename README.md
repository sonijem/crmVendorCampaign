- /input/daily_files - Where the supplierâ€™s files will land in the bucket. The filename
will look like supplier_file_YYYYMMDDHHmmSS.extension (e.g.
crm_campaign_20230101001500.json)
- /internal - Can be used to store any internal state that is needed and is not exposed to
the end user
- Reports are to be stored in: /output/reports
